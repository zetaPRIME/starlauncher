configurator for ui elements? maybe crtp after all
noap, macro/include shenanigans
new Button().at(40, 40).within(container).ofSize(64, 32).withText("Popsicles!");
shelved for now because shared_from_this is kind of dumb for what I need it for :D :D :D
(though maybe some trickery with putting the last-created-element in a static, combined with static factory pattern...)

example button, TouchScreenCanvas

maybe implement this: https://probablydance.com/2013/01/13/a-faster-implementation-of-stdfunction/

split stuff into libstarlight {
    namespaces
    actual lib split once everything's working I guess
    "" to <>
}
